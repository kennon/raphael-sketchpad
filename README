Raphael SketchPad
Version 0.1

Raphael Sketchpad is a simple drawing editor that you can easily include with your forms.
It is similar to Mai'Nada.net's InputDraw, but does not require Flash.
It is built on top of the Raphael Javascript vector graphics library.

Raphael Sketchpad requires these Javascript libraries: Raphael, jQuery, and JSON.stringify.
